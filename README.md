# Drag & Drop Todo Application 📝✨

Welcome to the frontend application repository! This repository contains the code for the frontend of our application. 🚀

## Getting Started 🛠️

To get started with the frontend application, follow the steps below:

### Cloning the Repository 📥

First, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/frontend-application.git
```

### Installing Dependencies 📦

Navigate into the cloned repository directory:

```bash
cd frontend-application
```

Then, install the necessary dependencies using npm:

```bash
npm install
```

### Running the Application 🚀

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the development server and open the application in your default web browser.

### Building for Production 🏗️

To build the application for production deployment, run the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will create a `build` directory containing the optimized production build of the application.

## Docker Instructions 🐳

### What is Docker? 🐋

Docker is a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers allow developers to package an application with all of its dependencies into a standardized unit for easy deployment.

### Dockerfile 📦

The Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. Using Dockerfile, you can automate the process of creating a Docker image for your application.

Here's a sample Dockerfile for this application:

```Dockerfile
# Use the official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:14 as build

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Build the application
RUN npm run build

# Production environment
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy build files to Nginx directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Expose port 80
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

### Pull Docker Image 📥

You can pull the Docker image for this application from Docker Hub using the following command:

```bash
docker pull alluri770/drag-drop-todo
```

### Run Docker Container 🚢

After pulling the Docker image, you can run an instance of the image using the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8080:80 alluri770/drag-drop-todo
```

This command will start a Docker container in detached mode (`-d`), exposing port 8080 on your local machine and mapping it to port 80 of the Docker container.

### View Application 👀

Once the Docker container is running, you can view the application by navigating to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your web browser.
